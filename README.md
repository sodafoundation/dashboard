## Introduction

SODA Dashboard provides a GUI interface through which the users can experience various features and capabilities added to each SODA Release. It provides an easy user setup and experience of all the key features integrated.

It can also provide the reference implementation for a client and gives an idea of how a client can be integrated with soda api and data platform.

The dashboard is mainly for providing the first hand experience for SODA Solutions. However, it could be referred for your production integrations

SODA Dashboard project is maintained by SODA Foundation directly.

can i know how we should run this soda dashboard project to locally in my system.
